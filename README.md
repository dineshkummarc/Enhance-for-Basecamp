# Basecamp Enhanced

A userscript for [Fluid.app](http://fluidapp.com/) and [basecamphq.com](http://basecamphq.com)

## About

This userscript can be used with your basecamphq.com instance of Fluid.app (SSB) to add some handy extras to make your life a bit easier. This userscript adds:

* Colour coded to-dos, currently 3 levels labelled by [HOT], [WARM] and [COLD]
* (To-do overview only) Adds buttons to collapse project to-do lists if they distract you from today's priority
* (To-do overview only) Adds quick links to a project's timesheet and individual to-do comment pages

Each of these features can be enabled or disabled though a simple config at the top of the script, and the colours for the 3 priority levels can also be set.

## Requirements

* [Fluid.app](http://fluidapp.com/)
* A [basecamphq.com](http://basecamphq.com) account.
* A [basecamphq.com](http://basecamphq.com) SSB created by Fluid.app.

## Install

1. Place the file into your Basecamp SSB's userscript folder located at ~/Library/Application Support/Fluid/SSB/<your-ssb-name>/Userscripts. You can also access this from your Basecamp SSB using Userscripts > Open Userscripts Folder.
2. In your Basecamp SSB, Userscripts > Reload All Userscripts, and then Userscripts > Basecamp Enhanced.
3. Reload the page or restart your SSB to ensure it has been installed correctly.

And that's it! You may need to reload the page or restart your SSB to ensure it has been installed correctly.
